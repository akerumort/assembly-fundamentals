# Arithmetic Average Calculator

This C++ program calculates the arithmetic average of a predefined array of 10 integers using inline assembly code.

## Task Description

The program:

- Defines an array of 10 integers: `{10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100}`.

1. Uses x86 assembly to:
   - Sum the array elements.
   - Divide the sum by 10 to compute the average.
2. Outputs the arithmetic average to the console.

## Usage

Compile and run the program using a C++ compiler supporting inline assembly (e.g., MSVC or GCC).

**Example Output:**

```
Arithmetic average: 55
```
