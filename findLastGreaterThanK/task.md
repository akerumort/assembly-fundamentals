# Last Element Greater Than K Finder

This C++ program finds the index of the last element in an array that is greater than a given value `k` using inline x86 assembly code.

## Task Description

The program:

- Defines an array of 5 integers: `{1, 5, 7, 3, 8}` and a threshold value `k = 6`.
- Uses x86 assembly to:
  - Iterate through the array.
  - Identify the last element greater than `k` and store its index.
- Outputs the index of the last element greater than `k`, or a message if no such element exists.

**Example Output:**

```
Index of the last element: 4
```
