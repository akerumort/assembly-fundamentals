# Positive Elements Sum Calculator

This C++ program calculates the sum of positive elements in a predefined array of integers using inline x86 assembly code.

## Task Description

The program:

- Defines an array of 9 integers: `{1, -3, 8, 1, 5, -2, 4, 8, 0}`.
- Uses x86 assembly to:
  - Iterate through the array until a zero is encountered.
  - Sum only the positive elements (greater than zero).
- Outputs the sum of the positive elements.

**Example Output:**

```
Sum of positive elements: 27
```
