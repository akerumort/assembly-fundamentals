# Even Numbers Extractor

This C++ program identifies and extracts even numbers from a predefined array of 10 integers using inline x86 assembly code.

## Task Description

The program:

- Defines an array of 10 integers: `{2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11}`.
- Uses x86 assembly to:
  - Iterate through the array and check each number for evenness.
  - Store even numbers in a separate array.
  - Count the number of even numbers found.
- Outputs the count of even numbers and the list of even numbers.

**Example Output:**

```
Number of even numbers: 4
Even numbers: 2 4 6 8
```
